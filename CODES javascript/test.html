    Hi this is Rohan

    <blockquote cite="https://wiki.endmyopia.org/wiki/20-20-20_rule#Do_you_need_the_20-20-20_rule?" >
        It was never an Endmyopia rule, it’s a mainstream optometrists / work ergonomics recommendation.

        Jake generally recommends longer breaks. He says that a break needs to be at least 10-15 minutes to be really effective. He also recommends to have 1 hour break after every 3 hours of close-up.
        
        But these are not strict rules. Generally what matters if you get ciliary spasm during your close-up or not. The best way to make sure is to check a Snellen chart or some “landmark” before you do close-up. You should be able to maintain the same acuity during close-up. If you detect blur on the same Snellen chart / landmark, then you should take a break.
        
        Edit: to avoid misunderstandings, the 20/20/20 doesn’t do any harm, but on it’s own is not enough to prevent or eliminate ciliary spasm.
